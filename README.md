SubFinder is a subdomain discovery tool that uses various techniques to discover massive amounts of subdomains for any target. It has been aimed as a successor to the [sublist3r project](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r). SubFinder uses Passive Sources, Search Engines, Pastebins, Internet Archives, etc to find subdomains and then it uses a permutation module inspired by altdns to generate permutations and resolved them at a great speed using a powerful bruteforcing engine. It can also perform plain bruteforce if needed. The tool is highly customizable and the code is built with modular approach making it easy to add functionalities and remove errors.



## Why ?

This project began it's life as a Bug Bounty World slack channel discussion. We (@ice3man & @codingo) were talking the channel about How sublist3r has been abandoned and the code is buggy, etc. I (@Ice3man) decided to rewrite the whole project and posted about it. @codingo asked to contribute to the project and I am happy that I let him contribute. 

So finally after working hard, here is something that I hope you guys will :heart:.
